rustup is used for controlling the version of rust(it is cli tool)

$ symbol is usede for terminal 
rs is extension for rust files

println! call a macro (if it is not there then it will function call)
(macro means predefined set of code written by rust)


for running the rust file :- 
rustc main.rs       //it will compile the code and generate the excecutable file 
.\main.exe 

main function is always the first excecutable code that run when we use excecutable file 
excecutable file is in binary so that any code can run it even without any rust setup

rustfmt is used to format the file of rs


rust is ahead of time compiled language means it can compile program and give excecutable file to someone else 


cargo is rust package manageer (just like npm)
cargo build is used to create a excecutable file often it here in the target folder 
cargo new pro_name // use to create new project 
so if we change the file ,then and then only it will recompile the code and then give the output 
if file is not change then it will not recompile , it will just run the code again
so for running use this :- cargo run
for identifying the error but it dont compile the code  use :- cargo check 
cargo build --release :- it will create target/release instead of target/debug which can be helpful when you want to publish the project
